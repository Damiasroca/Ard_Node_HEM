# Ard_Node_HEM
Yet another home energy monitor

*Arduino and NodeMCU Home energy monitor, home climate and air quality*

My first project as a complet newbie with arduino and Nextion displays.

Hardware:
  
  -Arduino Mega
	
  -NodeMCU 1.0 ESP 12F
	
  -Nextion Display 4.3" Enhanced Version NX4827K043 
	
  -Adafruit CCS811 Air Quality Sensor Breakout
	
  -Adafruit BME280 Humidity + Barometric Pressure + Temperature Sensor Breakout
	
  -Current Sensor SCT-013-000 (100A)
	
  -ZMPT101B Module for voltage measures

  -InfluxDB v2.00 
  
  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  
  In the "Nextion" folder you can find the .hmi file (nextion editor files), and all the images I used for my display
  
  Inside the other 2 folders you'll find the code for the mega and the code for the NodeMCU
  
  I'm sure that there's a million things to improve, if you want to collaborate, you'll be very welcome
